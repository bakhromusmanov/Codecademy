Green Thumb by Bakhrom Usmanov
Janet Kilburn once said, ‚ÄúThere are no gardening mistakes, only experiments!‚Äù. In this final project, we‚Äôll get to experiment with planting a vegetable in our very own virtual, iOS garden!
We‚Äôll utilize our knowledge of protocols, generics, and object-oriented concepts like structs and inheritance to build a program that provides us with planting, harvesting, watering, and general gardening tips.üå±
