Rock, Paper, Scissors by Bakhrom Usmanov
Rock, paper, scissors is a classic two player hand game dating back to ancient China.

Here are its universal rules:

Rock destroys scissors
Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
Keeping these guidelines in mind, weâ€™ll create a rock, paper, scissors program but with a modern twist - one of the players is a computer! ðŸ’»

rock, paper, scissors game

Our program will consist of 3 functions and utilize previously covered Swift concepts including if/else and switch statements to determine the winner amongst 2 players.
