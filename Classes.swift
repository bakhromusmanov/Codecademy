Build a PokÃ©dex by Bakhrom Usmanov
PokÃ©mon is an international phenomenon that has taken the world by storm. Somewhere in a remote village called Pallet Town, there is a PokÃ©mon Professor who is quietly studying these creatures.

We will let him introduce himself:

Hello, there! Welcome to the world of PokÃ©mon. My name is Oak. People call me the PokÃ©mon Professor.

This world is inhabited by creatures called PokÃ©mon. For some people, PokÃ©mon are pets. Others use them to fight. As for myselfâ€¦ I study pokÃ©mon as a profession.

There are over 896 PokÃ©mons now in the wild, each with different characteristics such as name, types, weaknesses, and more. Help Professor Oak study them by categorizing them each into an electronic device â€” a PokÃ©dex!

Write a Pokedex.swift program that stores different PokÃ©mon using classes and inheritance.
